# Technical Design

This page describes a technical approach for implementing the data structures and approaches defined during the 18-month project and three international, interdisciplinary Institutes in London, Athens and Ume√•.

## Scope

The solutions detailed here are a Proof-of-Concept, designed to be implemented fully at a later date. They are, to an extent agnostic regarding specific software and for the most part employ general principles applicable to graph databases and relational databases to represent the structure.

## Data Types

** Conceptual Object ** - in a single graph this represents the enduring concept that persists throughout the the metakinetic pathway. In the case of the Dancing Faun it is used to refer to a mythical persona for which a continuous artistic representation is evident.
*An object which represents a continuous and distinct identity and concept, even allowing for reproduction, modification , and adaptation.*
The Conceptual Object receives incomg links from ** Instances ** described as 'instance_of'

** Instance ** - a specific rendering of a Conceptual Object, e.g. a sketch of a reproduction of the Dancing Faun now in a public collection.

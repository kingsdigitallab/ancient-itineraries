# Technical Design

This page describes a technical approach for implementing the data structures and approaches defined during the 18-month project and three international, interdisciplinary Institutes in London, Athens and Ume√•.

## Scope

The solutions detailed here are a Proof-of-Concept, designed to be implemented fully at a later date. They are, to an extent agnostic regarding specific software and for the most part employ general principles applicable to graph databases and relational databases to represent the structure.

## Data Types

**Conceptual Object** - in a single graph this represents the enduring concept that persists throughout the the metakinetic pathway. In the case of the Dancing Faun it is used to refer to a mythical persona for which a continuous artistic representation is evident.
*An object which represents a continuous and distinct identity and concept, even allowing for reproduction, modification , and adaptation.*
The *Conceptual Object* receives incoming links from *Instances* as `instance_of`

**Instance** - a specific rendering of a Conceptual Object, e.g. a sketch of a reproduction of the Dancing Faun now in a public collection.
The Instance can recieve 1..n inbound links from *Segments* as `pathway_of`. The *Instance* may also exhibit outbound links to a *Style* as `has_style`.

**Segment** - an event or episode in the metakinetic pathway of the *Conceptual Object* linked to an *Instance* of the Object. In the Dancing Faun example the *Instance* represented by the Pompeii Faun exhibits inbound links from four *Segments* i.e. Creation, Burial, Excavation, and relocation to a museum.
A Segment can also exhibit a link to another Segment indicating its relative chronology as `is_contemporary_to` or `follows_chronologically`.
A Segment can exhibit a link to a *Location* via the outbound relationships `has_start_location` or `has_end_location`.
A Segement can link to a *LocationType* via the outbound relationship `has_location_type`.
A Segment can link to a *Chronology* via the outbound relationship `has_chronology`.
A Segment can link to an *EventType* via the outbound relationship `has_event_type`.

**Location**
